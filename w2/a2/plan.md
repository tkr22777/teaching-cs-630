# DB Assignment Plan

## Problem Domain Selection
- Choose business scenario with natural hierarchies
- Identify `two supertypes` with clear subtypes

## ERD Requirements
1. **Hierarchy Design**
   - Supertype 1 → Multiple subtypes
   - Supertype 2 → Multiple subtypes
   - Subtype discriminators for each hierarchy
   - Completeness constraints (total/partial)
   - Disjoint/overlapping constraints

2. **Relationships**
   - Supertype-to-any/other relationship
   - Subtype to another relationship

## Deliverables
1. **ERD Diagram**
   - Visual hierarchy representation
   - All constraints clearly marked
   - Discriminator attributes highlighted

2. **Table Implementation**
   - Sample data for all tables
   - Tables demonstrate constraint enforcement

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create ERD with entities and attributes on diagrams
- [ ] Add sample data
